# CISTERN — Failure Ledger

Append-only, per DESIGN-SPEC §5.3 and `reference/roguelike-agentic.md`.
One entry per dead/failed/retried run.

## L-001 (2026-08-30, run: plan-core — planning phase)

- Attempt: Expand ROADMAP Phases 1–2 into `docs/plans/01-core-rewrite.md`
  (read sources, draft the execution plan).
- Outcome: STALL (upstream idle timeout mid-turn)
- Evidence: run died after reading all sources (spec, roadmap, legacy
  cistern.el, DESIGN.md), before writing the plan file; no partial write
  landed in `docs/plans/`.
- Lesson: On a mid-turn upstream timeout, if the session retains its read
  context, steer-resume once before declaring death and re-briefing — do
  not discard completed reads.
- Change for next attempt: Steering resumed the same run with retained
  context (no re-brief, no re-read); the run delivered
  `docs/plans/01-core-rewrite.md` the next turn. Apply to future runs:
  steer-resume is the first corrective, death-and-replacement the second.
